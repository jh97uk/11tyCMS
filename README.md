If you want the source for 11tyCMS, please see the [Codeberg repo](https://codeberg.org/11tyCMS/11tyCMS) for more. Unfortunately, we can't host the releases there due to file size restrictions. 
** Please note that this is the only place you will find releases of 11tyCMS. **
# Why not host the source on GitHub?
11tyCMS is a project that seeks to help federate the web: I want more websites, I want more of our content, writing, creativity and the internet's soul to be out of the hands of centralised big tech platforms. GitHub and its parent company has shown itself to be ethically spurious to say the least on _many_ levels, and its use of AI training is deeply concerning. It's not something I want to contribute to. 
## But bots will still scrape Codeberg!
You're not wrong. But its more of sending a message than anything else. Besides that, my point on a more federated web is still important to me regardless.
